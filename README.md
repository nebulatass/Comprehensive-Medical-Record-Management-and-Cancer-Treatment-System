**Comprehensive Medical Record Management and Cancer Treatment System:**

  This project provides a comprehensive system for managing patient medical records, specifically focusing on cancer diagnosis and treatment plans. It leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to simulate a medical environment where patient information, diagnoses, treatment plans, and test results can be stored, analyzed, and updated.
Features:

    Patient Management: Create, update, and manage patient profiles.
    Diagnosis Tracking: Store diagnosis details like disease name and date.
    Medical Records: Link diagnoses to patients with treatment plans and test results.
    Feature Extraction: Extract and normalize key features from medical data.
    Treatment Plans: Design and track treatment plans for cancer patients.
    Test Results: Store and manage lab test results related to cancer.
    Appointment Scheduling: Manage appointments and follow-ups for patients.

Technologies Used

    Python 3.x
    pandas (for handling and processing medical data)
    scikit-learn (for dataset loading and basic data processing)
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
